How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

The code I checked was limited to only changed parts. 
Assuming that before chenges programm worked and after - it stopped working,
the reason is in this changed part.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

By being able to revert changes to any state. This allows to response the changes in requirements and to 
discover a root causes of bugs

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because Google Docs stores files like spreadsheets, or formatted text documents, that do not depend on other files. Code, on the other hand, has a lot of dependencies between files in project.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log inside the repository to see the history
git diff one_commit another_comit to see differencies between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
By giving me confidense that I can always go back in commits and see, where the bug was introduced.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
For the new js project.
