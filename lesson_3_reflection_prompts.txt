When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When somebody else is contributing to a project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because somebodie's commit might break the project. Or override what I've changed. Or I maight don't want these changes in my default branch

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are copies of another people's repositories on GitHub server. Clone is a copy of repository from GitHub to local computer. Branch is a copy of a code inside a local repository of GitHub repository.
